# What is a LinkedList?

> Read the heap and stack blog before reading this.

LinkedList is a data structure which is similar to an array but each element is pointed to the next element but a pointer.
In LinkedList, the elements are called nodes.
In data structures, nodes are knows as a structure that acts like elements in the main data structure.

In a rough representation, an Integer linked list looks like:

```Figure-1
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
```

Each element here is a node data structure, and each node is pointing to the next node.

```
Node{
  value: integer,
  next: location of the next node thats sitting in the heap memory
}
```

Looking at `figure-1`, we can say that each element in a node and is pointing to the next one.
We can also see that `1` is the first element so we need some variable that is holding `node 1` so that we can refer it for using it.

> Since each Node is a custom data type and it is not known at the compile time, nodes are stored in the heap memory, **So remember to free the memory of the node when you are done with it, high level languages have an inbuilt garbage collector so no need of worrying about it**

A linked list has 4 standard methods which are:

- Add First
- Add Last
- Remove First
- Remove Last
- Additionally there is also `insertAt()` but I'll not be adding it here.

## Add First

When calling this function, the node gets added in the first position.
For Example:

```textile
2 -> 3 -> 4

// When we do addFirst we are suppose make a node 1 that points to 2.
// And the variable thats holding the heap location of 2 will be changed to node(1).

// After adding: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

// Suppose there is no linked list, the variable will be holding null.
In that can we can make a null check and if true, make the variable hold the new node's position that we make.
```

Time Complexity of AddFirst: O(1);
Space Complexity of AddLast: O(1);

Judging from the space and time complexity we can say Add first is fairly an efficient method.

## Remove First

When calling this function, the node that is in the first position is removed.
This is simply done by removing the variable thats pointing to the first node and instead make it point to the second node, its that simple :).

For Example:

```
1 -> 2 -> 3

// After removing, the variable thats holding one will stack holding node(2)'s location.
// To get the position of node(2), we can do variable.next. Variable holds node(1) so next would hold the memory location of the next element.
// Since we know how to get the next Node's position, we can just make the variable hold the next position.
```

## Remove Last

When calling this method, we will iterate till the second node from last and change the `next` value to null so it will stop holding the position of the previous last
and hence we successfully remove last.

For Example:

```
1 -> 2 -> 3

// make a new variable that will move till it holds the node thats last second from the last.
// Node(2).next = null; Will make it point to a null object and hence will remove the node(3) out from the list.
```
