# Stacks

> Stack is a data structure where elements that enter last leaves first. This is similar to a stack of books.
> They are also known as, `LIFO`-**Last In First Out** or `FILO`-**First In Last Out**.

Stacks can be built using arrays or linkedlists. In this blog we will be using an array to build a stack.

The plain structure of Stack would look like this.

```java:Stacks.java
class stacks{
    private int[] items;
    private int count;
    private int capacity;

// Constructor for determining the size of the stack at the time of initialization
    public Stacks(int capacity){

        items = new int[capacity];
        this.capacity=capacity;

    }

    public void push(int value) {}

    public void pop() {}

    public int peek() {}

    public boolean isEmpty() {}

    @Override
    public String toString() {}


}
```

- `count` variable is the index for the next element that enters.

- `items` is the array that our stack will be in.

- `capacity` is the variable that holds the length of array, this is optional but used it since it made my code clean

Lets look at `push` Method:

```java:push.java

/*
 * Time: O(1)
 * Space: O(1)
*/

// Adds an element on top of the stack

public void push(int value){

    if(count == length) // Since our stack length is full
        return;

    items[count++]=value;
}
```

While pushing just make sure that you check if the stack is full or no, and if not full then go further :).

Instead of stopping the execution by using return, you can use exception but Ill leave this friendly and not put any exceptions.

Lets look at `pop` method:

```java:pop.java

/*
 * Time: O(1)
 * Space: O(1)
*/

//Removes the top element

public int pop(){

    if(count == 0) // No elements to pop
        // throw error so it doesn't go to the next step

    int temp = items[count]
    items[count--] = 0;
    return temp;
}
```

This method is used to remove elements from the stack.

Similar to `push` method, it is important to check if the stack is empty, and you can use exception here as well.

Lets look at `peek` Method:

```java:peek.java

/*
 * Time: O(1)
 * Space: O(1)
*/

// Returns the top element in the stack

public int peek(){

    if(count == 0)
        return; // throw err.

    return items[count-1];
}
```

Peek and pop are kinda similar, where both methods target the top element of the stack.
But the major difference is that, peek returns the element thats on the top of the stack and `doesn't remove the element`, whereas pop removes the element on the top from the stack.

Lets look at `isEmpty` Method

```java:isEmpty.java

/*
 * Time: O(1)
 * Space: O(1)
*/

public boolean isEmpty(){
    return count == 0;
}
```

This method can be used to check if the stack is empty. It returns true when count value is zero.

Lets look at `toString` Method:

```java:toString.java

/*
 * Time: O(n)
 * Space: O(n)
*/

@Override
public String toString(){
    var values = Arrays.copyOfRange(items,0,count);

    // This method makes a for loop and generates a new array, which results in a O(n) space.

    // Did this way to show you that this method exists.
    // Using a traditional for loop would allow you to achieve this method in O(1) space complexity.

    return Arrays.toString(values)
}
```

Method just for printing the stack
