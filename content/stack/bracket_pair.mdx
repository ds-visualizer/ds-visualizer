**Step 1:** check if the string and stack length is 0 then its a balanced string, if string string length is 0 but not stack length then its not a balanced string.

**step 2:** compare the first index of the string and if its an open bracket `push` it to the stack. However, if its a close
bracket then you compare with the bracket thats on top of the stack using `peek` method. If they aren't corresponding then it means
they aren't balanced bracket pair. `Pop` if they are corresponding brackets

**step 3:** Keep doing this till you reach the end of the stack.
