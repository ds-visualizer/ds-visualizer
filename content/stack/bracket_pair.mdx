**step 1:** compare the first index of the string and if it's an open bracket `push` it to the stack. However, if it's a close
bracket then you compare with the bracket thats on top of the stack using `peek` method. If they aren't corresponding then it means
they aren't balanced bracket pair. `Pop` the element in stack if they are corresponding brackets

**step 2:** Keep doing this till you reach the end of the stack.

**step 3:** If the stack is empty at the ending of the loop, then it's a balanced parenthesis.
