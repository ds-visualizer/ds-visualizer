# Linked List Code

> LinkedList is a data structure where each element is connected to the next element's memory location.

Generally LinkedList are done in `2 ways`, one way by using `2 pointers` where one points `Head` and `Tail` node.

In this blog we will use 2 pointers where one holds first node and other holds tail node.

The plain structure of LinkedList would look like this.

```java:LinkedList.java
class LinkedList {

	class Node {
		int value;
		Node next = null;

		public Node(int value) { // Constructor for a Node
			this.value = value;
		}
	}

	private Node head = null; // head and tail are pointers to the nodes
	private Node tail = null;
	private int length = 0;

// length is optional but can change the time of `size()` method to go from O(n) to O(1) and has no effect on the space.
// Ways to decrease time ðŸ˜‰.

  /*
   * head, tail and length are private because you don't want to access them outside of the class,
   * You can make getters which is a good practice if you want to read private variables.
   */

	public void addFirst(int value) {}

	public void addLast(int value) {}

	public void insertAt(int index, int value) {}

	public void removeFirst() {}

	public void removeLast() {}

	public void remove() {}

	public void toString() {}

	public int get(int index) {}

	public int size() {}

	// Some more methods which will not be covered here.

}
```

**in this case**, Node is the structure of each node that's `inside` the LinkedList, `value` is the data that's inside of the node, and `next` is a pointer that holds the heap location of the
node you want to point it to.

Lets look at `addFirst` Method:

```java:addFirst.java

/*
 * Time: O(1)
 * Space: O(1);
 */

public void addFirst(int value) {
  length++;

  Node node = new Node(value);

  if (this.head == null) {
		this.head = this.tail = node;
		return;
  }

  node.next = head;
  head= node;

  // Node(0) 1 -> 2
  // 0 -> 1 -> 2
  // just link 0 to head
}
```

Basically it says if head isn't holding any node that means `there is no linked list available`, then we make head and tail refer to the new Node.

Otherwise, we need to add a new node to the head. We do this by making a node and them `pointing next to head`. Doing this we added a node before head.
But, don't forget to change the pointer head as well to the new node otherwise it will still be pointing towards the previous head.

> This is done in the time complexity of O(1) and space complexity of O(1) as well.

Lets look at `addLast` method:

```java:addLast.java

	/*
 	* Time: O(1)
 	* Space: O(1);
 	*/

	public void addLast(int value) {
		Node node = new Node(value);
		length++;

		if (this.head == null) {
			this.head = this.tail = node;
			return;
		}

		tail.next = node;
		tail = tail.next;

		// 1 -> 2 0
		// 1 -> 2 -> 0
		// just link tail to 0
	}
```

This looks similar too isn't? we already have a variable that's pointing to the last node, so all we do now is make `tail point to the new Node` and
after doing that just make tail pointer to be equal to the new node we added since the new Node is the **tail node**.

Lets look at a cooler method now ðŸ˜Ž, `insertAt(int index, int value)`:

```java:insertAt.java

	/*
 	* Time: O(n)
 	* Space: O(1);
 	*/

	public void insertAt(int index, int value) {

		if (index > length || index < 0) // This is required cuz if index is 0 or greater than the size of linked list,
			return; 													 // we shouldn't be able to add a new node

		if (index == 0) { // This is optional which I have done, but U can skip it.
			addFirst(value);
			return;
		}

		if (index == length) {
			addLast(value);
			return;
		}

		/*
		* index == length is optional as well but I did this to reduce the time complexity
		* How does this reduce time? ðŸ¤”
		*
		* If you look at the bottom code, we had to iterate till the index element,
		* and we know addLast is O(1) operation so why do you want to make this do O(n) when it can be
		* done in O(1). So I decided to do this, if index = length, then do addLast()
		*
		* More hacks ðŸ˜‰
		*/

		/*
		 * Suppose 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 is the linked list, and
		 * we want to add Node(4) at index 2,
		 *
		 * So we make a temporary pointer and and move it till it gets hold of Node(1)'s, position.
		 * After doing this, we make Node(1) point to the new node and new node point to Node(2),
		 * N by this we added a new node :0
		 */

		length++;
		Node current = head;
		Node node = new Node(value);
		for (int i = 0; i < index - 1; i++) { // this for loop is the reason why insertAt method becomes O(n)
			current = current.next;
		}

		// After the for loop, current will be holding Node(1);

		Node temp = current.next;

		// Make a temporary variable such that it holds the other nodes that's after 1

		current.next = node;

		// Point Node(1) to the new Node, 0 -> 1 -> 4

		node.next = temp;

		// finally point the new node to old node, in this example Node(2), 0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3

	}
```

### Lets analyse the code

**Step 1:** We add length since we are adding a Node into it.

**Step 2:** So what is current? current is a pointer, which initially points to the
first node.

**Step 3:** We need to get hold of the element that's before the give index.

```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
```

Suppose we want to add the element `node(5)` at index 2, which is at Node(3) position, we need to be able to get till Node(2) and make it point to the Node
that we will be creating.

So to get hold of the Node(2), we are using a for loop.

**Step 3:** After iterating till the prev Node of index, we need to make it point to the new Node(value).
We basically do this by changing element's next to hold the new memory location.

```
1 -> 2 -> 5
3 -> 4
```

After doing that, Node(2) will be pointing towards 5 but 5 will not be pointing to anything, **So what happened to Node(3) and the rest ðŸ˜£??**

**Step 4:** Since we don't want to lose the other nodes, we store them in a temp variable before adding 5. So then after adding 5, we can make node(5)
point towards the other temp pointer which is storing all the other nodes.

**ANDDD BY THIS, I HOPE U UNDERSTOOD THIS METHOD!!! :)**

Alright that was a ride, lets get back to some easier methods now :):

Lets look at how to remove nodes from the last 'removeLast:`

```java:removeLast.java

	/*
 	* Time: O(n)
 	* Space: O(1);
 	*/

	public void removeLast() {
		if (head == null)
			return;

		length--;

		if (head.next == null) {
			head = tail = null;
			return;
		}
		Node current = head;
		while (current.next.next != null) { // This loop is used to iterate till the last second Node
			current = current.next;
		}

		// then point last second node to null which remove the last node.
		current.next = null;
		tail = current;
	}
```

In this we go till the last second node, and make the last second node point to `null` and change our `tail pointer` to point the new last node.
if there is no node to remove, we will just stop the method.

Similarly Lets look at 'removeFirst`:

```java:removeFirst.java

	/*
 	* Time: O(1)
 	* Space: O(1);
 	*/

	public void removeFirst() {
		if (head == null)
			return;

		length--;

		head = head.next;
	}
```

In this method, all we do is is point head pointer to the next node.

```
1 -> 2 -> 3

// Suppose head is 1 and head.next is 2
// we will just make pointer head to start holding 2, and doing that we need to get
// hold of Node(2)'s position

2 -> 3
// head pointer is now holding 2 instead of 1.
```

`toString()` method:

```java:toString.java

	/*
 	* Time: O(n)
 	* Space: O(1);
 	*/

	public String toString(){

		String str = "[";
		Node current = head;

		while(current != null){ // Since we are iterating thru every element, the time complexity turns out to be O(n)
			str += current.value + ", ";
			current = current.next;
		}

		return str.substring(0,str.length()-2) + "]";
		// this is just for decoration, you can return the string however you want to :/.
	}
```

This should look fairly simple, we just iterate thru the loop and add the value to str and finally we return the string.

Similar to this method, we also have `get(int index)`:

```java:get.java

	/*
 	* Time: O(n)
 	* Space: O(1);
 	*/

	public int get(int index){
		Node current = head;

		if(index < 0 || index >= length) return; // if statement is true, index out of bound ERRRRRR.

		for(int i = 0; i < index; i++) { // iterate till the index node and return the node's value
			current = current.next;
		}

		return current.value;
	}
```

In this method we just iterate till the index node and return the value of current.

For this task lets implement a getter ðŸ™‚ which is called `size`:

```java:size.java

	/*
 	* Time: O(1)
 	* Space: O(1);
 	*/

	// Thanks to us storing length, we could make this an O(1) operator, otherwise it would turn out to be O(n)

	pubic int size() {
		return length;
	}
```

This is just a getter to read the length property.

Alright lets go back to another tough method, `remove(int index)`:

```java:remove.java

	/*
 	* Time: O(n)
 	* Space: O(1);
 	*/

	public void remove(int index) {

		if (index >= length || index < 0)
			return;

		if(index == 0) {
			removeFirst();
			return;
		}

		if(index == length-1) {
			removeLast();
			return;
		}

		/*
		 * Suppose 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
		 * if we want to remove index 3, we iterate till 2,
		 * then make Node(2).next to point it to 4 instead of pointing it to Node(3).
		 * By doing this, no node will be referencing 3 anymore, and hence Node(3) will get removed from the list.
		 * Result: 1 -> 2 -> 4
		 */

		Node current = head;

		for (int i = 0; i < index - 1; i++) { // This for loop is the reason find becomes an O(n) complexity.
			current = current.next;
		}

		current.next = current.next.next;
		length--

	}
```

**Now with all the information you read, try to build contains method. That's your homework ðŸ˜‰**
