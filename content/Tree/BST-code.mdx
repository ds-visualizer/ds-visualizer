# Binary Search Tree (BST) Code

> BST is a data structure that spreads out like a tree. The first element of the tree is known as the `root`. In a BST,
> values that are smaller than the root are on the left side of the root, which are refereed as `leftChild`.
> Values that are greater or equal to the root are on the right side of the root, which are refereed as `rightChild`.

The plain structure of BST would like this.

```java:BST.java
class BST{
    public class Node {
        private Node leftChild;
        private Node rightChild;
        private int value;

        public Node(int value) {
            this.value = value;
        }

    // The following method is optional
    // This method is to look at the node values clearly while debugging.

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return "Value = " + value;
        }
    }

    private Node root;

    /*
    * leftChild, rightChild, root are private because you don't want to access them outside of
    * the class.
    * You can make getter which is a very good practice if you want to read private variables
    */


    public void insert(int value);

    public boolean find(int value);

    public int height()

}
```

**In this case**, Node is the structure of each node that's _inside_ the tree. `value` is the data that's inside of the node, and
`leftChild` is a pointer that holds the heap location of the node that is on on the left side of the root node. Similarly,
`rightChild` is a pointer that holds the heap location of the node that is on the right side of the root node.

Lets look at `insert` Method:

```JAVA:insert.java

/*
 * Time: O(log n)
 * Space: O(1)
 */

    public void insert(int value) {
        Node node = new Node(value);

        // When there is no root, the node becomes the root

        if (root == null) {
            root = node;
            return;
        }

        Node current = root;
        while (true) {

         // Checking if the value is less than or greater than the current

            if (value < current.value) {

            // When the leftChild of current node is null, the new node is placed over there

                if (current.leftChild == null) {
                    current.leftChild = node;
                    break;
                }
                current = current.leftChild;
            } else {

            // When the rightChild of current node is null, the new node is places over there

                if (current.rightChild == null) {
                    current.rightChild = node;
                    break;
                }
                current = current.rightChild;
            }
        }
    }
```

Initially the method checks if the root is empty and adds the node as the `root` if it is empty. Otherwise, taking the `root` as `current` we
traverse the tree either on the left side (when the `value` is less than root value) or on the right side (when the `value` is greater or equal
to root value). When right place found by traversing, the node gets added to the left or right depending on the value it is.

Lets look at `find` Method:

```JAVA:find.java
/*
 * Time: O(log n)
 * Space: O(1)
 */

// This method is to check if a particular value is present in the tree

    public boolean find(int value) {
        Node current = root;
        while (current != null) {

            if (value == current.value)
                return true;

            else if (value > current.value)
                current = current.rightChild;

            else if (value < current.value)
                current = current.leftChild;
        }
        return false;
    }
```

`find` method works similarly to the `insert` method. It iterates from the root and checks if the value lies on left side or
right side and returns true when the `current` value equals to `value`.

Lets look at `height` Method:

```JAVA:height.java

/*
 * Time: O(n)
 * Space: O(1)
 */

// Method overloading

    public int height() {
        return height(root);
    }

    private int height(Node root) {
        // Base condition
        if (root == null)
            return 0;

        return 1 + Math.max(height(root.leftChild), height(root.rightChild));
    }
```

In this method, we keep calling the method again and again and when we reach a **null** we will return 0 and stop the recursion.
Then compare the max of left and right subtree, which ever is greater, thats the height of the tree.
