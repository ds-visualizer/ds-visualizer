## About

Our goal is to help programmers understand different types of data structures and algorithms. We go through the code by splitting into multiple blocks so its easy for beginners to
understand and walk through and follow up. **Time** and **space** complexities are given for each method implementation in the code block so you shouldn't get confused.
We also explained why the time complexity is what it is suppose to be.
