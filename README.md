This is a friendly project that aims to teach people constructing data structures
with the help of visualizers and code explanation.

Currently only available in java but python will be coming soon in few months.

We go through the code by splitting into multiple blocks so its easy for beginners to
understand and walk through and follow up. **Time** and **space** complexities are given for each method implementation in the code block so you shouldn't get confused.
We also explained why the time complexity is what it is suppose to be.

Any bug or typo, please put up an issue in `issue` section or try contributing it by
