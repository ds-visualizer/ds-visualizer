# Pairs In An Array

Given an array arr[] of n integers, the task is to find all the pairs possible from the given array. It isn't necessary for the array to be sorted.

> **Time Complexity:** O(nlogn) <br/> **Space Complexity:** O(1)

```text:example.txt

Input:
  arr: 1 2 3 4 -2 -3
  target: 1

Output:
  2. Since there are 2 pairs that sum up to 1.
  [[3, -2],[4, -3]]

```
